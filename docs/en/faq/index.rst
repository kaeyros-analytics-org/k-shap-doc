==================

#. What is K-Shap, and who is it for?
    K-Shap is a web application designed to help organizations manage and monitor disbursements. It is ideal for companies looking to streamline their disbursement processes by implementing a structured validation hierarchy and ensuring all financial transactions are properly tracked and approved.

#. How do I register my company on K-Shap?
    To register your company on K-Shap:

    #. Create the company in the K-Shap system.
    #. Define the validation statuses (Accepted, Rejected, In Progress) and the maximum disbursement amounts.
    #. Set up user roles, including Financial Validator, Head of Department, Cashier, and Agent.
    #. Create the first user, who will be an administrator with all roles, responsible for setting up additional users and roles.

#. What are the mandatory roles in K-Shap, and what do they do?
    K-Shap requires four mandatory roles:

    * **Financial Validator:** Validates disbursements within an assigned amount range.
    * **Head of Department:** Manages and validates disbursements within their department.
    * **Cashier:** Finalizes and handles the disbursement of funds.
    * **Agent:** Initiates disbursements within their department.

#. Can I customize the names of the validation statuses and user roles?
    Yes, you can customize the names of validation statuses and user roles to fit your organizationâ€™s terminology. However, the functionality and hierarchy of these statuses and roles must remain consistent with the default setup (e.g., Accepted, Rejected, In Progress for statuses).

#. What happens if a disbursement is rejected?
    If a disbursement is rejected at any validation stage, the validator must provide a reason for the rejection. The disbursement process will not proceed further until the issues causing the rejection are resolved.

#. Who can initiate a disbursement in K-Shap?
    Any company employee assigned the role of Agent, Head of Department, or Financial Validator can initiate a disbursement. The initiator is the person responsible for starting the disbursement process.

#. How does K-Shap ensure that disbursements are validated correctly?
    K-Shap implements a structured validation hierarchy where disbursements must be approved at multiple levels:

    #. The Head of Department validates disbursements within their department.
    #. The Financial Validator approves disbursements within their assigned amount range.
    #. The Cashier finalizes the disbursement after all prior validations.

    Each validator is notified at their respective stage and must approve or reject the disbursement with a reason provided for any rejection.

#. Can a Financial Validator approve any disbursement amount?
    No, a Financial Validator can only approve disbursements within the specific amount range assigned to them by the company's main administrator. This ensures that financial controls are maintained according to the organization's policies.

#. How does the notification system work in K-Shap?
    K-Shap automatically notifies relevant users at each step of the disbursement process:

    * The Head of Department is notified when a disbursement is initiated.
    * The Financial Validator is notified after the Head of Department's approval.
    * The Cashier is notified once the Financial Validator approves the disbursement.
    * The Initiator is notified when the disbursement is finalized and ready for collection.

    These notifications help ensure that disbursements are processed promptly and that all relevant parties are kept informed.

#. What are the restrictions for the Head of Department role?
   The Head of Department can only view and validate disbursements related to their own department. They cannot access or manage disbursements from other departments, ensuring that departmental boundaries and responsibilities are respected.

#. What happens after a disbursement is approved?
    Once a disbursement is fully approved (validated by the Head of Department, Financial Validator, and Cashier), the Initiator receives a notification. The Initiator can then visit the Cashier to collect the disbursed amount.

#. Can a company use K-Shap for disbursements across multiple departments?
    Yes, K-Shap supports disbursement management across multiple departments within a company. Each department can have its own Head of Department who manages and validates disbursements specific to that department.
    
#. How can I manage the validation hierarchy within my company?
    As an administrator, you can define the validation hierarchy by setting up the required user roles and assigning them to employees within your company. You also assign amount ranges to Financial Validators, ensuring that disbursements are validated according to your company's financial policies.

#. Is it possible to change the validation statuses or user roles after the company is set up?
    Yes, administrators can update validation statuses and user roles even after the initial setup. However, it's important to ensure that any changes align with the overall disbursement process to maintain the integrity of validations.
