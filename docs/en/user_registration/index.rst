1. Company Registration
============================
To begin using K-Shap, a company must first be registered on the platform. The registration process involves setting up key elements that will govern the disbursement process within the organization.

2. Configuration Steps
===========================
**a. Create the Company**
    * Register the company's name and essential details within the K-Shap system.
**b. Define Validation Statuses**
    * Mandatory Statuses:
        #. Accepted
        #. Rejected
        #. In Progress
    * These statuses are essential for tracking the outcome at each step of the disbursement process. Companies can name these statuses differently, but they must conform to the outlined logic.
**c. Define Disbursement Amounts**
    * Assign the maximum amount that can be disbursed under each validation status. This helps in controlling the financial boundaries for disbursement approvals.
**d. Define User Roles**
    * Mandatory Roles:
        #. Financial Validator
        #. Head of Department
        #. Cashier
        #. Agent
    * While companies can customize the names of these roles, they must align with the outlined responsibilities.
**e. Create the First User (Administrator)**
    * The first user created within the company acts as the administrator. This user has all roles assigned and is responsible for creating other users and assigning roles within the company.
**f. Assign Roles and Amount Ranges**
    * The administrator assigns specific roles to users and defines the amount ranges that financial validators can approve. A financial validator's authority is limited to the amounts specified by the administrator.
