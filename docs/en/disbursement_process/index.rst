1. Initiating a Disbursement
==============================

* Any company employee (agent, head of department, or financial validator) can initiate a disbursement. This employee is referred to as the Initiator.

2. Validation Workflow
==========================
* **Step 1: Head of Department Validation**
    * The Head of Department (HoD) is notified of the initiated disbursement.
    * The HoD reviews and either accepts or rejects the disbursement. If rejected, a reason must be provided.
* Step 2: Financial Validator Validation
    * Upon HoD approval, the Financial Validator is notified.
    * The validator reviews the disbursement, ensuring it falls within their assigned amount range, and either accepts or rejects it. A reason is provided in case of rejection.
* Step 3: Cashier Validation
    * Once the financial validator has approved the disbursement, the Cashier is notified.
    * The Cashier finalizes the disbursement by validating it.
* Final Step: Notification to Initiator
    * Once the Cashier has validated the disbursement, the Initiator is notified of the approval.
    * The Initiator then proceeds to the Cashier to collect the disbursed amount.

3. Validation Constraints
============================
* At each validation stage, the disbursement can either be accepted or **rejected**.
* If a disbursement is rejected, the validator must provide a reason for the rejection.
* Specific constraints include:
    * **Agent:** Belongs to a department and can initiate disbursements.
    * **Head of Department:** Can only view and validate disbursements for their own department.
    * **Financial Validator:** Can only validate disbursements within their assigned amount range.
